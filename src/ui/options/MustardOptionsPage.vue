/**

 * Purpose:

 * extension-wide settings, manage their account, and adjust preferences.
 *
 * How to access in Chrome:
 * Method 1: Right-click the Mustard extension icon → Select "Options"
 * Method 2: Go to chrome://extensions → Find "Mustard" → Click "Options" or "Extension options"
 * Method 3: Programmatically via chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage() API

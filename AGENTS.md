# Agent Rules

## Product & Strategic Decisions

**IMPORTANT**: For product and strategic decisions, always read and reference the `README.md` file, specifically the "Project Vision" section. This contains the project goals, MVP scope, and strategic direction that should guide all implementation decisions.

## Progress Tracking

**PROGRESS.md Purpose**: The `PROGRESS.md` file documents the current implementation status of Mustard features. It serves as a quick reference to compare against `README.md` to determine what features are already implemented versus what still needs to be built.

**Updating PROGRESS.md**:

- **ALWAYS check with the user** before updating PROGRESS.md
- When the user indicates completion (e.g., "ok this works now!", "nice we are done", "perfect!", etc.), suggest updating PROGRESS.md
- Update messages should be **very concise with maximum information density**
- Example format: "Can now access <feature> via <component/location>"
- The purpose is to quickly compare implementation status against the README.md vision
